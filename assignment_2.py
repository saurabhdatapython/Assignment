# 1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

# Ans 1

# In[1]:


#Boolean Datatype are the datatype which gives value of true or false.
#Eg:
a=True
b=False
print(a)
print(b)


# 2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?

# Ans: The three differnt types of Boolean operators in python are: or and not

# In[2]:


a=100
b=200
print(a>50 and b>100) # Example of boolean and
print(a>200 or b>100) # Example of boolean or
print(not(a>10)) # Example of boolean not


# 3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate) ?
Ans: The Truth tables for the boolean tables are as follows:

Truth Table for and operaotor
True and True is True
True and False is False
False and True is False
False and False is False
Truth Table for or operaotor
True and True is True
True and False is True
False and True is True
False and False is False
Truth Table for not operaotor
True not is False False not is True4. What are the values of the following expressions ?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)
# In[3]:


print((5>4)and(3==5)) # False
print(not(5>4)) # False
print((5>4)or(3==5)) # True
print(not((5>4)or(3==5))) # False
print((True and True)and(True==False)) # False
print((not False)or(not True)) # True


# 5. What are the six comparison operators?

# Ans: The Six comparision operators available in python are:
# == , != , < , > , <= , =>

# 6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one ?

# Ans: == is the equal to operator that compares two values and evaluates to a Boolean, while = is that assignment operator that stores a value in a variable.
7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')
# Ans: In Python, code block refers to a collection of code that is in the same block or indent. This is most commonly found in classes, functions, and loops.

# In[6]:


spam = 0
if spam == 10:# block 1
    print('eggs')

if spam > 5:
    print('bacon')# bloc2

else:
    print('ham') #block three
    print('spam')
    print('spam')





# 8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

# In[7]:


def spamvalue(spam):
    if spam==1:
        print('Hello')
    elif spam==2:
        print('Howdy')
    else:
        print('Greetings')
        
spamvalue(1) 
spamvalue(2)
spamvalue(3)


# 9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
# 

# Ans: Press Ctrl-c to stop a program stuck in an infinite loop
# and can terminate kernal 

# 10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?

# Break statement mainly used to terminate the enclosing loop such as while, do-while, for or switch statement wherever break is declared.
# and Continue statement mainly skip the rest of loop wherever continue is declared and execute the next iteration.

# 11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?

# In[24]:


b= range(10)# it will go for 0 to 9 number 
for i in  b:
    print(i,end="")


# In[19]:


a= range(0,10) # it will print start 0 to end 9 
for i in a:
    print(i, end="")


# In[29]:


c= range(0,10,1)# starat with 1 end jump of 1
for i in c:
    print(i,end="")


# 12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
# program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

# In[33]:


for i in range(1,11):
    print(i, end="")


# In[3]:


a=1
while a <=11:
    a+=1 
    print(a, end="")


# In[7]:


i=1
while i<=10:
    print(i,end="")
    i+=1


# 13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam ?

# Ans: This function can be called with spam.bacon()
